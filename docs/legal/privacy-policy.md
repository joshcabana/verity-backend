# Verity Privacy Policy (Draft)

**Last updated:** February 14, 2026  
**Region:** Australia-first, web-only beta

This is a draft privacy policy for Verity and not legal advice.

## Scope
This policy explains how Verity handles personal information for the web beta.

## Data We Collect
- Account and authentication data (anonymous account ID, access/session tokens)
- Onboarding data (date of birth and consent confirmations when provided)
- Profile and communication data after matching (name, photos, bio, chat messages)
- Usage and diagnostics data (device metadata, IP address, user agent, security logs)
- Payment and purchase metadata related to token purchases (processed by Stripe)

## How We Use Data
- Provide core app functionality (matching, sessions, mutual reveal, messaging)
- Enforce safety systems, moderation, fraud checks, and abuse prevention
- Process purchases, maintain service reliability, and troubleshoot incidents
- Comply with legal obligations and respond to lawful requests

## Privacy Act and APP Alignment (Australia)
Where the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) applies, we aim to handle personal information consistently with the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs), including:
- APP 1 (open and transparent management)
- APP 6 (use and disclosure)
- APP 8 (cross-border disclosure)
- APP 11 (security)
- APP 12 and APP 13 (access and correction)

## Sharing and Processors
We use service providers to operate Verity, including:
- **Agora** (video infrastructure)
- **Hive** (real-time moderation tooling)
- **Stripe** (payments)

We share only information reasonably necessary for those services.

## Cross-Border Disclosure and Transfers
Some providers may process personal information outside Australia.

Before disclosing personal information to overseas recipients, we seek to take reasonable steps in the circumstances so recipients handle information in a manner consistent with applicable APP requirements (including APP 8 where applicable). Depending on circumstances, we may remain accountable for overseas handling under Australian law.

Safeguards may include contractual controls, vendor due diligence, and technical security measures.

## Data Retention
- Queue/session operational data is retained only as long as needed for matching and safety operations
- Non-match session records are targeted for short retention (currently up to 24 hours unless longer retention is required for security, incident response, legal, or regulatory reasons)
- Account and transaction records may be retained for compliance, fraud prevention, and dispute handling
- On valid deletion requests, we delete or de-identify personal information unless retention is required or authorised by law

## Your Rights
Depending on applicable law, you may request:
- Access to personal information we hold about you
- Correction of inaccurate or out-of-date information
- Deletion of eligible personal information
- Information about how personal information is handled

## Security
We apply layered technical and organisational safeguards designed to protect personal information. No method of storage or transmission is completely secure.

## Children
Verity is for adults (18+) only.
