# Verity Privacy Policy (Draft)

**Last updated:** February 14, 2026  
**Region:** Australia-first, web-only beta

This is a draft privacy policy for Verity and not legal advice.

## Scope
This policy explains how Verity handles personal information for the web beta.

## Data We Collect
- Account and authentication data (anonymous account ID, access tokens)
- Onboarding data (date of birth and consent confirmations when provided)
- Profile and communication data after matching (name, photos, bio, chat messages)
- Usage and diagnostics data (device metadata, IP address, user agent, security logs)
- Payment and purchase metadata related to token purchases (processed by Stripe)

## How We Use Data
- Provide core app functionality (matching, sessions, mutual reveal, messaging)
- Enforce safety systems, moderation, fraud checks, and abuse prevention
- Process purchases, maintain service reliability, and troubleshoot incidents
- Comply with legal obligations and respond to lawful requests

## Legal Bases (where applicable)
- Performance of our contract with you (providing the service)
- Legitimate interests (safety, fraud prevention, service improvement)
- Consent (where required, including specific notices)
- Legal compliance obligations

## Sharing and Processors
We use service providers to operate Verity, including:
- **Agora** (video)
- **Hive** (live moderation)
- **Stripe** (payments)

We share only what is reasonably necessary for those services.

## Data Retention
- Queue/session operational data is retained only as long as needed for matching and safety operations
- Non-match session records are targeted for short retention (currently up to 24 hours unless required longer for security/legal reasons)
- Account and transaction records may be retained for compliance, fraud prevention, and dispute handling
- You can request deletion; we will delete or de-identify data unless we must keep it by law

## International Transfers
Some providers may process data outside Australia. We use contractual and technical safeguards appropriate to risk.

## Your Rights
Depending on applicable law, you may request:
- Access to personal information
- Correction of inaccurate information
- Deletion of eligible personal information
- Information about how your data is used

## Children
Verity is for adults (18+) only.

## Security
We use layered technical and organisational controls designed to protect personal information, but no system is perfectly secure.
