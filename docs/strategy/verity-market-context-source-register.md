2. Tier C claims are allowed in internal planning if labeled **assumption**.
3. Re-verify Tier A/B claims quarterly or before major fundraising/press activity.

## Immediate next actions

- Source-lock global user and revenue figures from a citable, dated dataset/report.
- Add one independent source for gender-ratio assumptions to reduce single-source risk.
- Add a short citation appendix for copy/paste deck use.
