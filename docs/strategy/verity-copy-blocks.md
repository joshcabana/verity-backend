# Verity Copy Blocks (Deck + PRD + KPI Gate Language)

> Purpose: Ready-to-paste language using source-locked claims where available.

## 1) One-liner positioning

**Verity isn’t about finding the best profile — it’s about feeling real chemistry in under a minute.**

## 2) Problem statement (deck/PRD)

Mainstream dating products optimize for browsing, not connection. Users often experience swipe fatigue, message imbalance, and inconsistent interaction quality before they ever feel a real spark.

## 3) Source-locked market context block (safe for external use with citations)

In the U.S., online dating is mainstream behavior: 30% of adults report they have used a dating site or app, and that rises to 53% among adults under 30 (Pew, 2023). Experience is also asymmetric: among recent users, 54% of women report feeling overwhelmed by message volume, while 64% of men report insecurity due to too few messages (Pew, 2023). At the same time, relationship intent remains meaningful: 44% of recent users say meeting a long-term partner is a major reason they use online dating (Pew, 2023).

## 4) Product mechanism block

Verity changes the sequence:
1. Meet live first (45 seconds).
2. Decide privately (Match or Pass).
3. Reveal only on mutual consent.

This shifts filtering from profile curation to real-time human presence.

## 5) Trust & safety block

Verity is designed as a controlled environment, not an anonymous free-for-all. Calls are actively moderated for policy violations, severe behavior can trigger immediate session termination, and repeat offenders face escalating enforcement.

## 6) Monetization block

Verity uses a token model to reward intentional behavior, not endless scrolling. Core access includes a free baseline. Tokens are for acceleration and experience layers (priority matching, faster re-queue, themed rooms) and are governed by fairness safeguards.

## 7) KPI gate language (paste into PRD)

A stage can advance only when liquidity, safety, and product-signal gates are simultaneously green:

- Liquidity: match wait p50 <= 30s, p90 <= 90s, queue abandonment <= 15%
- Safety: severe incidents <= 3/10k calls, severe-action latency p95 <= 2s
- Product signal: call completion >= 85%, chat activation >= 60% after mutual match, D7 return >= 22%

If any universal no-go trigger is hit (severe incidents spike, queue p90 sustained breach, appeal backlog SLA breach), rollout pauses automatically.

## 8) Slide copy: Why now

- Digital dating adoption is already high.
- Existing interaction patterns produce fatigue and asymmetrical outcomes.
- Users still show strong intent for meaningful connection.
- Verity’s 45-second live-first model addresses these frictions at the interaction layer.

## 9) Slide copy: Why Verity wins

- No browse loop = less decision fatigue
- Time-boxed live interaction = higher presence
- Mutual reveal only = lower rejection theater
- Safety-first operating model = higher trust potential

## 10) Compliance note (use in any external draft)

Global market-size and app-level gender ratio figures remain in source-lock review. Use only verified claims from `docs/strategy/verity-market-context-source-register.md` unless a claim is explicitly labeled as an assumption.
